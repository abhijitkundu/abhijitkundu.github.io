title={{Nerflets: Local Radiance Fields for Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Scene Representation from 2D Supervision}},
author={Xiaoshuai Zhang and Abhijit Kundu and Thomas Funkhouser and Leonidas Guibas and Hao Su and Kyle Genova},
abstract={We address efficient and structure-aware 3D scene representation from images. Nerflets are our key contribution -- a set of local neural radiance fields that together represent a scene. Each nerflet maintains its own spatial position, orientation, and extent, within which it contributes to panoptic, density, and radiance reconstructions. By leveraging only photometric and inferred panoptic image supervision, we can directly and jointly optimize the parameters of a set of nerflets so as to form a decomposed representation of the scene, where each object instance is represented by a group of nerflets. During experiments with indoor and outdoor environments, we find that nerflets: (1) fit and approximate the scene more efficiently than traditional global NeRFs, (2) allow the extraction of panoptic and photometric renderings from arbitrary views, and (3) enable tasks rare for NeRFs, such as 3D panoptic segmentation and interactive editing.},

author={Abhijit Kundu and Kyle Genova and Xiaoqi Yin and Alireza Fathi and Caroline Pantofaru and Leonidas Guibas and Andrea Tagliasacchi and Frank Dellaert and Thomas Funkhouser},
abstract={We present Panoptic Neural Fields (PNF), an object-aware neural scene representation that decomposes a scene into a set of objects (things) and background (stuff).  Each object is represented by an oriented 3D bounding box and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes position, direction, and time and outputs density and radiance.  The background stuff is represented by a similar MLP that additionally outputs semantic labels. Each object MLPs are instance-specific and thus can be smaller and faster than previous object-aware approaches, while still leveraging category-specific priors incorporated via meta-learned initialization. Our model builds a panoptic radiance field representation of any scene from just color images. We use off-the-shelf algorithms to predict camera poses, object tracks, and 2D image semantic segmentations. Then we jointly optimize the MLP weights and bounding box parameters using analysis-by-synthesis with self-supervision from color images and pseudo-supervision from predicted semantic segmentations. During experiments with real-world dynamic scenes, we find that our model can be used effectively for several tasks like novel view synthesis, 2D panoptic segmentation, 3D scene editing, and multiview depth prediction.},

title={Kubric: A scalable dataset generator},
abstract={Data is the driving force of machine learning, with the amount and quality of training data often being more important for the performance of a system than architecture and training details. But collecting, processing and annotating real data at scale is difficult, expensive, and frequently raises additional privacy, fairness and legal concerns. Synthetic data is a powerful tool with the potential to address these shortcomings: 1) it is cheap 2) supports rich ground-truth annotations 3) offers full control over data and 4) can circumvent or mitigate problems regarding bias, privacy and licensing. Unfortunately, software tools for effective data generation are less mature than those for architecture design and training, which leads to fragmented generation efforts. To address these problems we introduce Kubric, an open-source Python framework that interfaces with PyBullet and Blender to generate photo-realistic scenes, with rich annotations, and seamlessly scales to large jobs distributed over thousands of machines, and generating TBs of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Kubric by presenting a series of 13 different generated datasets for tasks ranging from studying 3D NeRF models to optical flow estimation. We release Kubric, the used assets, all of the generation code, as well as the rendered datasets for reuse and modification..},

title={{im2nerf: Image to Neural Radiance Field in the Wild}},
author={Lu Mi and Abhijit Kundu and David Ross and Frank Dellaert and Noah Snavely and Alireza Fathi},
abstract={We propose im2nerf, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural object representation given a single input image in the wild, supervised by only segmentation output from off-the-shelf recognition methods. The standard approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative experiments on Open Images dataset. We show that in all cases, im2nerf achieves the state-of-the-art performance for novel view synthesis from a single-view unposed image in the wild.},

abstract={With the recent growth of urban mapping and autonomous driving efforts, there has been an explosion of raw 3D data collected from terrestrial platforms with lidar scanners and color cameras. However, due to high labeling costs, ground-truth 3D semantic segmentation annotations are limited in both quantity and geographic diversity, while also being difficult to transfer across sensors. In contrast, large image collections with ground-truth semantic segmentations are readily available for diverse sets of scenes. In this paper, we investigate how to use only those labeled 2D image collections to supervise training 3D semantic segmentation models. Our approach is to train a 3D model from pseudo-labels derived from 2D semantic image segmentations using multiview fusion. We address several novel issues with this approach, including how to select trusted pseudo-labels, how to sample 3D scenes with rare object categories, and how to decouple input features from 2D images from pseudo-labels during training. The proposed network architecture, 2D3DNet, achieves significantly better performance (+6.2-11.4 mIoU) than baselines during experiments on a new urban dataset with lidar and images captured in 20 cities across 5 continents.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation of 3D meshes is an important problem for 3D scene understanding. In this paper we revisit the classic multiview representation of 3D meshes and study several techniques that make them effective for 3D semantic segmentation of meshes. Given a 3D mesh reconstructed from RGBD sensors, our method effectively chooses different virtual views of the 3D mesh and renders multiple 2D channels for training an effective 2D semantic segmentation model. Features from multiple per view predictions are finally fused on 3D mesh vertices to predict mesh semantic segmentation labels. Using the large scale indoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmark of ScanNet, we show that our virtual views enable more effective training of 2D semantic segmentation networks than previous multiview approaches. When the 2D per pixel predictions are aggregated on 3D surfaces, our virtual multiview fusion method is able to achieve significantly better 3D semantic segmentation results compared to all prior multiview approaches and recent 3D convolution approaches.},

abstract={We present a simple and flexible object detection framework optimized for autonomous driving. Building on the observation that point clouds in this application are extremely sparse, we propose a practical pillar-based approach to fix the imbalance issue caused by anchors. In particular, our algorithm incorporates a cylindrical projection into multi-view feature learning, predicts bounding box parameters per pillar rather than per point or per anchor, and includes an aligned pillar-to-point projection module to improve the final prediction. Our anchor-free approach avoids hyperparameter search associated with past methods, simplifying 3D object detection while significantly improving upon state-of-the-art.},

title={An LSTM Approach to Temporal 3D Object Detection in LiDAR Point Clouds},
abstract={Detecting objects in 3D LiDAR data is a core technology for autonomous driving and other robotics applications. Although LiDAR data is acquired over time, most of the 3D object detection algorithms propose object bounding boxes independently for each frame and neglect the useful information available in the temporal domain. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a sparse LSTM-based multi-frame 3d object detection algorithm. We use a U-Net style 3D sparse convolution network to extract features for each frame's LiDAR point-cloud. These features are fed to the LSTM module together with the hidden and memory features from last frame to predict the 3d objects in the current frame as well as hidden and memory features that are passed to the next frame. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional frame by frame approach by 7.5% mAP@0.7 and other multi-frame approaches by 1.2% while using less memory and computation per frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use an LSTM for 3D object detection in sparse point clouds.},

title={Adversarial Texture Optimization from RGB-D Scans},
abstract={Realistic color texture generation is an important step in RGB-D surface reconstruction, but remains challenging in practice due to inaccuracies in reconstructed geometry, misaligned camera poses, and view-dependent imaging artifacts. In this work, we present a novel approach for color texture generation using a conditional adversarial loss obtained from weakly-supervised views. Specifically, we propose an approach to produce photorealistic textures for approximate surfaces, even from misaligned images, by learning an objective function that is robust to these errors. The key idea of our approach is to learn a patch-based conditional discriminator which guides the texture optimization to be tolerant to misalignments. Our discriminator takes a synthesized view and a real image, and evaluates whether the synthesized one is realistic, under a broadened definition of realism. We train the discriminator by providing as `real' examples pairs of input views and their misaligned versions -- so that the learned adversarial loss will tolerate errors from the scans. Experiments on synthetic and real data under quantitative or qualitative evaluation demonstrate the advantage of our approach in comparison to state of the art. Our code is publicly available with video demonstration.},

title={DOPS: Learning to Detect 3D Objects and Predict their 3D Shapes},
abstract={We propose DOPS, a fast single-stage 3D object detection method for LIDAR data. Previous methods often make domain-specific design decisions, for example projecting points into a bird-eye view image in autonomous driving scenarios. In contrast, we propose a general-purpose method that works on both indoor and outdoor scenes. The core novelty of our method is a fast, single-pass architecture that both detects objects in 3D and estimates their shapes. 3D bounding box parameters are estimated in one pass for every point, aggregated through graph convolutions, and fed into a branch of the network that predicts latent codes representing the shape of each detected object. The latent shape space and shape decoder are learned on a synthetic dataset and then used as supervision for the end-to-end training of the 3D object detection pipeline. Thus our model is able to extract shapes without access to ground-truth shape information in the target dataset. During experiments, we find that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results by ~5% on object detection in ScanNet scenes, and it gets top results by 3.4% in the Waymo Open Dataset, while reproducing the shapes of detected cars.},

Many traditional 2D vision outputs, like instance segmentations and depth-maps, can be obtained by simply rendering our output 3D scene model. We exploit class-specific shape priors by learning a low dimensional shape-space from collections of CAD models. We present novel representations of shape and pose, that strive towards better 3D equivariance and generalization. In order to exploit rich supervisory signals in the form of 2D annotations like segmentation, we propose a differentiable Render-and-Compare loss that allows 3D shape and pose to be learned with 2D supervision.

author={Abhijit Kundu and Yin Li and Frank Dellaert and Fuxin Li and James M. Rehg},
abstract={We present an approach for joint inference of 3D scene structure and semantic labeling for monocular video. Starting with monocular image stream, our framework produces a 3D volumetric semantic + occupancy map, which is much more useful than a series of 2D semantic label images or a sparse point cloud produced by traditional semantic segmentation and Structure from Motion(SfM) pipelines respectively. We derive a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model defined in the 3D space, that jointly infers the semantic category and occupancy for each voxel. Such a joint inference in the 3D CRF paves the way for more informed priors and constraints, which is otherwise not possible if solved separately in their traditional frameworks. We make use of class specific semantic cues that constrain the 3D structure in areas, where multiview constraints are weak. Our model comprises of higher order factors, which helps when the depth is unobservable.We also make use of class specific semantic cues to reduce either the degree of such higher order factors, or to approximately model them with unaries if possible. We demonstrate improved 3D structure and temporally consistent semantic segmentation for difficult, large scale, forward moving monocular image sequences.},

abstract={This paper presents a realtime, incremental multibody visual SLAM system that allows choosing between full 3D reconstruction or simply tracking of the moving objects. Motion reconstruction of dynamic points or objects from a monocular camera is considered very hard due to well known problems of observability. We attempt to solve the problem with a Bearing only Tracking (BOT) and by integrating multiple cues to avoid observability issues. The BOT is accomplished through a particle filter, and by integrating multiple cues from the reconstruction pipeline. With the help of these cues, many real world scenarios which are considered unobservable with a monocular camera is solved to reasonable accuracy. This enables building of a unified dynamic 3D map of scenes involving multiple moving objects. Tracking and reconstruction is preceded by motion segmentation and detection which makes use of efficient geometric constraints to avoid difficult degenerate motions, where objects move in the epipolar plane. Results reported on multiple challenging real world image sequences verify the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

abstract={Detection of moving objects is a key component in mobile robotic perception and understanding of the environment. In this paper, we describe a realtime independent motion detection algorithm for this purpose. The method is robust and is capable of detecting difficult degenerate motions, where the moving objects is followed by a moving camera in the same direction. This robustness is attributed to the use of efficient geometric constraints and a probability framework which propagates the uncertainty in the system. The proposed independent motion detection framework integrates seamlessly with existing visual SLAM solutions. The system consists of multiple modules which are tightly coupled so that one module benefits from another. The integrated system can simultaneously detect multiple moving objects in realtime from a freely moving monocular camera.},

title={Moving Object Detection by Multi-View Geometric Techniques from a Single Camera Mounted Robot},
author={Abhijit Kundu and K. M. Krishna and J. Sivaswamy},
abstract={The ability to detect, and track multiple moving objects like person and other robots, is an important prerequisite for mobile robots working in dynamic indoor environments. We approach this problem by detecting independently moving objects in image sequence from a monocular camera mounted on a robot. We use multi-view geometric constraints to classify a pixel as moving or static. The first constraint, we use, is the epipolar constraint which requires images of static points to lie on the corresponding epipolar lines in subsequent images. In the second constraint, we use the knowledge of the robot motion to estimate a bound in the position of image pixel along the epipolar line. This is capable of detecting moving objects followed by a moving camera in the same direction, a so-called degenerate configuration where the epipolar constraint fails. To classify the moving pixels robustly, a Bayesian framework is used to assign a probability that the pixel is stationary or dynamic based on the above geometric properties and the probabilities are updated when the pixels are tracked in subsequent images. The same framework also accounts for the error in estimation of camera motion. Successful and repeatable detection and pursuit of people and other moving objects in realtime with a monocular camera mounted on the Pioneer 3DX, in a cluttered environment confirms the efficacy of the method.},
