Passionate about advancing the frontiers of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.

I currently work at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). Previously I was with the [Perception](https://research.google/teams/perception/) team at [Google Research](https://research.google/).

I finished my PhD in [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-computer-science) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). At Georgia Tech, I was co-advised by [Jim Rehg](https://rehg.org/) and [Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/). Before that, I was at [Robotics Research Lab](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) of [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India where I worked with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) and [Prof. C. V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/).
